## Introduction

This repository contains my solution for the Front-End Interview Design System technical test, focused on implementing a robust and reusable Tabs component.

### Objectives
The primary goals of this exercise were to deliver a component that is:

- **Reusable**: Designed to integrate seamlessly into a larger Design System.
- **Accessible**: Follows WAI-ARIA tab patterns for keyboard and screen reader support.
- **Customizable**: Supports multiple visual variants (pill, underline) and flexible styling.
- **Composable**: Allows a Badge to be rendered within any Tab.
- **Framework-agnostic**: Built from scratch in React and CSS, without any UI libraries or CSS frameworks.

### Features
- Full HTML and CSS implementation (no frameworks)
- React-based Tabs logic with clear, maintainable code
- Multiple Tabs variants: `pill` and `underline`
- Badge support: easily inject different Badge variants via the Tab API
- Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys, Home, and End for accessibility
- Storybook integration for documentation and live preview (optional)

### Approach
My focus throughout was on clarity, maintainability, and extensibility, ensuring the Tabs component is production-ready and fits naturally into a real-world Design System. The implementation prioritizes accessibility, developer experience, and ease of future extension.
